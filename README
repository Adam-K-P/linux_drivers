Drivers
_______

This repository contains the work that I've been doing with the Linux kernel.
Linux Device Drivers 3rd Edition, The Linux Kernel in a Nutshell, Linux Systems
Programming, and the internet were all reffered to extensively for this project.

The directory 'ldd3-examples' contains examples from Linux Device Drivers 3rd
Edition that are compilable/runnable with a modern Linux kernel.  I did not 
write these drivers, though I made small, occassional edits on a few files.
