mem_test

written by Adam Pinarbasi

This is a program that tests memory corruption in 64 bit Linux systems.
Instructions on using this program are given by the "help" command.
To download this program you may use "git clone" to put it into your directory.

This program will test memory while the computer is online, but will not tests
memory being used by the operating system.

If you need to test all the memory in your system, please use memtestx86 which
is included in the kernel build.

It is up to you to ensure that you are testing appropriate addresses.  If you
test an inappropriate kernel address (which you may do) you could potentially 
crash your system.

You can also crash user processes by testing random addresses so please do not
do this.

This program is released under the GPL license so you may do with it however 
you please.

This is part of a school project.  This program is written as a kernel driver.
If you intend on seriously using this, you may note that this can be done in
user space, potentially.  This is by design, as this is an exercise in kernel
drivers.
