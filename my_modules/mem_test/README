mem_test

This is a program that can test memory corruption at specified addresses and
test a system under low-memory conditions.



Memory corruption test
______________________

mem_test tests for memory corruption with the established method used by 
mm/memtest.c.

Namely, it writes a pattern to an address then reads back the data at that
address.  If the data at the address matches the data originally written
to the address, then the memory is fine -- if the data differs from the 
tested pattern though, the memory is corrupted.



Memory stress test

mem_test can test a system under low-memory conditions too.  It performs this
by allocating some amount of memory if a quantity is specified by the user, or
it simply aquires every free page -- forcing every program without memory 
already set aside for use to use swap files: causing a great deal of strain
on a system.
