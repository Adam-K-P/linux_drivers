These are modules that I have totally written myself (with, of course, help from the ldd3 book).  My goal in these modules is to implement the features that the book discusses without just copying their examples.  In fact, the examples in the book are old enough that they won't even compile on a modern kernel, and some of their methods are deprecated, so major changes have to be made regardless.
