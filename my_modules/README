I have worked on the following Linux drivers:



scull
_____

A Simple Character Utilitly for Loading Localities.

This program is very similar to the ldd3 "scull" example, but is not as complex.

All this program does is reads a string from user space, stores it into kernel
space, then writes it back to user space.



mem_test
________

A program for testing memory.

The program offers two memory tests. 

The first is a memory corruption test.  It works by testing some chunk of memory
specified by the user.

The second tests your system's operation under low-memory conditions.  It does 
this by either holding some amount of memory specified by the user or reserving 
all available memory.
